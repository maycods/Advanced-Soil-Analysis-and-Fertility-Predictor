# Advanced Soil Analysis and Fertility Predictor

It consists on a multifunctional agricultural tool that analyzes soil properties data, and categorize these soils into different groups by detecting patterns then predicts their fertility.

There is also a seperate section that analyses and visualize a COVID-19 cases evolution.

 The project integrates data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, clustering, classification, association rule mining, evaluation and implemention a recommender system based on frequent itemsets.
