# Advanced Soil Analysis and Fertility Predictor 🚜

It consists on a multifunctional agricultural tool that analyzes soil properties data, and categorize these soils into different groups by detecting patterns then predicts their fertility.

There is also a seperate section that analyses and visualize a COVID-19 cases evolution.

 The project integrates data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, clustering, classification, association rule mining, evaluation and implemention a recommender system based on frequent itemsets.

**Note**: All methods and algorithms are implemented from scratch.

Run the `IHM.py` then a url of the interface will be displayed in your terminal

    
## Examples 

The project includes a **GUI** built using Gradio that provides an interactive environment for users to perform data analysis and data mining tasks for soil properties and covid cases evolution.
